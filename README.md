Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of used cars across the market.

Data Preparation, Data Manipulation, Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistics:
●	Come up with appropriate results and visuals for the following:
o	Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a used car?

Model Building:
•	Build appropriate ML model/s on the data.
•	Compare various ML models with appropriate regularization and/or hyper-parameter tuning.
•	Evaluate the performance of the models.
•	Identify the right metric to evaluate the performance of the model.
